// JavaScript variables are containers for data values. Objects are variables too, but they can contain many values.

// Think of an object as a list of values that are written as name:value pairs, with the names and the values separated by colons.


// === object literal===

let person = {
    name: "Robert",
    age:32,
    favColor: "blue",
    height: 123
}


// accessing object elemet using objectName.methodName()
console.log(person.favColor)
// or
console.log(person['favColor'])
